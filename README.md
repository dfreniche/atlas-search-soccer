In May 2022, Electronic Arts and FIFA consciously decoupled after 30 years of bringing gaming bliss to football enthusiasts across the globe.

gone are the ... 'expressions from the game, what you see, what you do... HEARING "GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL"
I am neither a gamer nor a football enthusiast, but I am a soccer mom. The EA FIFA gaming franchise gave me cheap, wholesome, and countless hours of babysitting. Park your child in front of any gaming console with EA FIFA, and there he/she would stay. Amused, entertained, but mostly still and not breaking anything.

EA FIFA, you let me fold the laundry. You let me finish dinner. You let me read a book. You let me speak on the phone. Uninterupted! <WISTFUL SIGH> and now you're gone - leaving me to despair for all the current soccer moms. Will they ever know a love like ours?

EA FIFA, AtlasSearchSoccer is my tribute to you. Part eulogy, part love song... oh, yeah. And part Atlas Search tutorial.
?? some corny expression about missing and loving someone - not knowing what they had until it's gone ??

<paragraph about the app taking the FIFA 22 player dataset>

when my now adult, still soccer-playing son comes home to commandeer the big screen and the kitchen for the European championships, I hope somebody somewhere learns about how to use Atlas Search's compound operator to quickly and easily build fine-grained searches. Maybe she'll find that mad skilled Polish goalie with the impossible to spell name. Maybe use the wildcard operator find the up-and-coming hotshot from Manchester United whose name begins with an R, I think?

list of the tech to learn...

and while these developers are using Atlas Search to quickly and easily build their FIFA dream team, I'll curl up with a (most likely technology) book and remember you, EA-FIFA.
