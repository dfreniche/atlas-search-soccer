<h2 align="center">Build your FIFA Dream Team with MongoDB Atlas Search</h2>

Hello! üëã

In May 2022, Electronic Arts and FIFA consciously decoupled after 30 years of bringing gaming bliss to soccer enthusiasts across the globe. üòî üò¢ I am neither a gamer nor a soccer enthusiast, but I am a soccer mom. The EA Sports FIFA gaming franchise never failed to provide me with countless hours of wholesome and free babysitting. Park your child in front of any gaming console with EA FIFA, and there he/she would stay. Amused, entertained, but mostly still and **_not breaking anything_**!!

EA Sports FIFA, <a href="https://www.atlassearchsoccer.com"><b>Atlas Search Soccer</b></a> is my tribute to you. Part eulogy, part love song. Oh yeah, and part Atlas Search tutorial.

Teaming up MongoDB Atlas Search with the FIFA22 player dataset, you can scour across the over 22,000 players in the database based on a variety of search parameters and data types:

- player name
- player position
- nationality
- club
- skill level
- age
- salary

Equipped with only a searchbox, sliders and checkboxes, find the world's best players with the most inpossible-to-spell names to build out your own FIFA Dream Team. Autocomplete, wildcard, and filters to find Ibrahimoviƒá, B≈Çaszczykowski, and Szczƒôsny? No problem!

As you interact with the application, you'll see the `$search` operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline live in-action! Click on the Advanced Scouting image for more options using the `compound`. Learn all the ways and plays to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches across text, date, and numerics.

When you pick a footballer for your team, he is written to local storage on your device. That way, your Dream Team stays warmed up and on the pitch even after you close your browser.

<h2>Using Atlas App Services as Your Serverless Backend....</h2>
<p>AtlasSearchSoccer uses HTTP services in App Services to create 5 APIs to allow you to query for your restaurant data over HTTP: </p>

The data is queried from `useHomeFetch.js` in the `hooks` directory.
Here you'll find the endpoints for the backend search queries using the `$search` operator:

- `BasicSearchEndPoint`
- `WildcardEndPoint`
- `AutocompleteEndpoint`
- `AdvancedSearchEndPoint`
- `FacetsEndPoint`
  Find the code for these webhooks in the <code>AppServices</code> folder.</p>
