<h2 align="center">Build your FIFA Dream Team with MongoDB Atlas Search</h2>

Hello, sports fans & non-sports fans alike! ðŸ‘‹

In May 2022, Electronic Arts and FIFA consciously decoupled after 30 years of bringing gaming bliss to soccer enthusiasts across the globe. I am neither a gamer nor a soccer enthusiast, but I am a soccer mom. The EA FIFA gaming franchise gave me cheap, wholesome, and countless hours of babysitting. Park your child in front of any gaming console with EA FIFA, and there he/she would stay. Amused, entertained, but mostly still and not breaking anything.

EA FIFA, <b>Atlas Search Soccer</b> is my tribute to you. Part eulogy, part love song. Oh yeah, and part Atlas Search tutorial.

Teaming up MongoDB Atlas Search with the FIFA22 player dataset, you can scour across the 22,00 players in FIFA22 player database based on a variety of search parameters and data types:

- player name
- player position
- nationality
- club
- skill level
- age
- salary

Equipped with only a searchbox, sliders and checkboxes, find the world's best players with the most inpossible-to-spell names to build out your own FIFA Dream Team. Autocomplete, wildcard, and filters to find IbrahimoviÄ‡, BÅ‚aszczykowski, and SzczÄ™sny? No problem!

<p><em>Note: This dataset is mocked. Please do not use to make actual dining decisions.</em></p>

<p> Atlas Search Soccer implements many Atlas Search features from autocomplete to search facets. Using the $search operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, we can build fine-grained searches across text, numerics, and geospatial data. By building out your FIFA dream team, you'll learn all sorts of ways MongoDB allows you to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches on your Atlas data.</p>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**

- fuzzy matching
- wildcard
- autocomplete
- range queries
- facets
- relevance-based scoring

<p>Check out the video to see a demonstration of all the features or visit the link below to play around with the finished application, hosted entirely in MongoDB Atlas:</p>

<p>This application is hosted entirely by MongoDB Atlas was created using:</p>

- React

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- A MongoDB Atlas account. Get one for free <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">here.</a>
- A recent version of Node.js and npm.
- EA FIFA 22 player dataset (players22.json) provided in the data folder.
- (Recommended) <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass - GUI</a>

<p>You can read and download the dataset using the MongoDB Shell, any MongoDB driver, or my favorite MongoDB Compass using the following URI:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
mongodb+srv://mongodb:atlassearch@shareddemoapps.dezdl.mongodb.net/whatscooking
</code>
</pre>

<p>It is also included in this repo's data folder as <pre>whatscooking.json</pre></p>

<h2>Using Realm as Your Serverless Backend....</h2>
<p>AtlasSearchSoccer uses HTTP services in Realm to create 5 APIs to allow you to query for your restaurant data over HTTP: </p>

- `GetRestaurantsEndPoint` called from the `useHomeFetch.js` hook.
- `GetFacetsEndpoint` called from the `useHomeFetch.js` hook.
- `Suggestions_AC_Endpoint` called from the `SearchBar.js` component.
- `getSynonyms` called in the `SynonymsPage.js`.

As you choose your players, they are written to local storage on your device so that your dream team persists even after you close your browser.
Find the Realm application and code for these webhooks in the <code>AtlasSearchSoccer_Realm</code> folder.</p>
